Jaden Hawa's Daily Journal

9/16: Today Trevor and I decided to do an LED swivel fan, we decided that the fan would be rotating and we would put LED's on the blades to illustrate and image.
9/17: Today we created the design file, and google document with all of the needed instructions for the fan, further enhancing our knowledge about the fan and our goals for the final project. 
9/18: We started to look at more tutorials and made the dimensions of the fan.
9/24-9/30: We worked on a owl soldering project to better and reinforce our skills. 
10/1: Today Trevor and I redesigned how we wanted to project to look, more like Drake's Summer Mink cologne with the LED portion still intact.
10/6: Today I compiled all of the files/tutorials I needed and made a big spreadsheet and material list of things that I need to either purchase or find. 
Materials: 
DC motor
straight/L/T shaped pvc pipes
Wood for base (either circular or cross shaped).

10/7: Today I made a spread sheet for all of the materials and their costs and the quantity of which I needed. https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SfSwBPdIAURw1k8l9iMx8ntQyuyOnjgF6MBGMapDFN0/edit?gid=0#gid=0 
10/9: Today I finished the spread sheet and Trevor and I printed a practice 3d print of a surfboard. 
10/17: Today we learned how to set up pages and how to use a template. 
10/28-10/31 - today we have been working on our knowledge of fusion 360 and learning the ropes of it.
10/30- Today I milled a PCB board using a standard milling machine and a copper-clad board. I prepared the design files, set up the material, and ran the milling process to create the traces, holes, and board outline. The overall process went smoothly, and the finished board matched the design. There were a few small imperfections along some edges, likely from slight variations in cutting depth, but the board is functional and ready for the next steps in assembly and testing.
