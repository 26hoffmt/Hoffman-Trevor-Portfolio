Jaden Hawa's Daily Journal

9/16: Today Trevor and I decided to do an LED swivel fan, we decided that the fan would be rotating and we would put LED's on the blades to illustrate and image.
9/17: Today we created the design file, and google document with all of the needed instructions for the fan, further enhancing our knowledge about the fan and our goals for the final project. 
9/18: We started to look at more tutorials and made the dimensions of the fan.
9/24-9/30: We worked on a owl soldering project to better and reinforce our skills. 
10/1: Today Trevor and I redesigned how we wanted to project to look, more like Drake's Summer Mink cologne with the LED portion still intact.
10/6: Today I compiled all of the files/tutorials I needed and made a big spreadsheet and material list of things that I need to either purchase or find. 
Materials:
